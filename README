This is a repository of useful script created by me

make-shower-from-google-docs probably requires you to install googlecl and csvtool. 

port-forward will only require openssh-client

cvs-status requires cvs, iconv and gawk (iconv because the server i use cvs against is iso-8859-1, not utf-8)

reto requires bash, grub2, sudo and visudo, dbus-send, grub-reboot, 
dialog, zenity, and a system that uses Consolekit (most *buntu's)
It also requires the following changes: 
/etc/default/grub: GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
visudo: %sudo   ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/grub-reboot

dec2ip (and hex2ip) requires awk (or gawk) (and bash (dooh))

pack-client requires bash, cat, tar, gpg, sed
 Script for packing files required for a OPENVPN client
 into a GPG password protected *.tar-file.

splitm4achap requires ffprobe, ffmpeg, bash, sed, grep
 Script for generating ffmpeg commands for splitting mp4/m4a/m4v by chapters

mergem4achap requires mp4v2-utils (mp4chaps, mp4info), ffmpeg, bc, sed, grep
 Merges multiple m4a's files (can be modified for video) and insers chapters for files
 To run on every other file in a folder: (replace == with != to take the other half)
   mergem4achap $(find . -type f -name '*.m4a' | sort | awk 'NR % 2 != 0')

hild1-install requires bash, grep, ssh, ssh-keygen, scp, apt-get
 Script for setting up a "default" install like i like it on a new machine

say requires libttspico-utils and bash
